# Evolv.io improved!

This project is a [Rust] port of the [Processing code] from [carykh] and contributors.
The code was 100% rewritten but includes most ideas of the [Processing code] with a lot merely being translated into [Rust].

# Why is this improved?

Because it's in [Rust] of course!

There are (or will be: WIP) a number of reasons why this version is better than the original:
- WIP: better documentation
- Performance, [Processing] isn't known for anything resembling speed, at least not when compared to [Rust].
- Flexibility, don't like my graphical implementation? Just use `Board` and build your own!

The original version has since also [been converted](https://github.com/evolvio/evolv.io/) to Java
(No, I am not going to provide a link; Java isn't worthy of that).
This version still provides:
- a (subjectively) better language (if you haven't noticed: I hate Java)
- WIP: (hopefully) less bugs because of [Rust]'s guarantees
- (probably) better performance
- maybe more but I AM NOT LOOKING AT JAVA CODE ANY LONGER TO COMPARE

# Performance

## Graphics
At the time of writing, my implementation is pretty terrible so turning the graphics off will help.

## Running benchmarks
I have written some benchmarks to assess the performance of this crate.
You can run them with `cargo bench --features=bench`.
Please note that this only works in nightly (`rustup default nightly` to use it by default).
Type `rustup toolchain install nightly` to install the latest nightly build; `rustup toolchain uninstall nightly` to uninstall again.

## Sudden performance boosts or dips
So, you played around a bit and it's now twice, or even 100 times, as fast?
This is most likely caused by a change to the constants in `constants.rs`,
the benchmarks use `DEFAULT_BOARD_SIZE` for example to test the performance of a `Board` with that size!
This can cause huge performance improvements or, well, a huge decline in performance...
If you're sure you didn't change the scale of calculations but only made them more efficient: please submit a pull request on github!
Performance is a critical part of this application and any improvements are welcome!

## Multithreading
This is on my list but could be a bit tricky because of my usage of `unsafe` (for information about `safe` and `unsafe` [Rust], see [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/safe-unsafe-meaning.html)).
I'm working on removing any use of `unsafe` which will significantly ease the process of converting to multithreaded code.
Also, it remains to be seen how much it will help.

# Conclusion

## Involving people with technology
The original project by [carykh] got a lot of people involved with programming or at least interested.
Modifications to the code were however hard because it wasn't very well documented and pretty messy.
I hope to make it easier to contribute to this version by eventually providing good documentation and clean code.

My choice of [Rust] is a mixed blessing: it runs blazingly fast, prevents a lot of bugs and is my favorite language.
It does however have a pretty steep learning curve and I spent months fighting with the compiler when I was getting started.
I dedicated a section below to getting involved with this project, [Rust] or just programming in general.

## Bashing on Java
As a wise men once said: ["Ceterum censeo Javam delendam esse."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est)

I hope the Java programmers can take the joke and not hack me up into bits; also, would you stop passing around so many references inside of your classes?
`cargo` was getting hysterical...

I may have been a bit mean to Java so feel free to [bash] on Rust.
(Not that you're going to find anything to [bash] on... üòÅ)

## Feeling intimidated by Rust?
If you're already a programmer I suggest the following route (maybe it was my route):

1. try [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) or [C++](https://isocpp.org) or another low-level programming language and get frustrated with the many bugs, crashes and segfaults...
2. come to [Rust]! Start reading your way through ["the book"] and get scared off...
3. have a final go with your low-level language of choice and decide that this time, you **will** get the luxury of proper memory management...
4. learn [Rust]!

For those who are new to programming: try something like [Python] or [Processing] first,
they're both newbie-friendly programming languages with a large and active community.

Also, you don't have to know [Rust] to tinker with the constants in `constants.rs`;
they can change the way `evolvim` behaves a lot. Feel free to experiment with them!
