//! If you want to tinker around with the world of `evolvim` and try to get different creatures,

//! Change the constants in this file to whatever you want, compile, and you're off to a world with brand new possibilities!
//! You should be able to find a description of what each constant does and estimate it's impact.
//! Have fun!
